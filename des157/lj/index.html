        <h2>Interactive Storytelling: Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills </h2>
        <h3>April 29, 2021</h3>
        <p>
          In an <a href="https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">article</a> written by Michael Gonchar about close reading and visuals thinking skills, the author talks about the importance of slowing down
          and taking the time to notice details and dig deeper to find the meaning of the text/image and understand its story or even promote discussion. Some tips that the author provides
          to slow down include being detectives, practicing regularly, asking open-ended questions, noticing details, build on others' observations, starting conversations, and more. Something that
          I thought was useful was when the author mentioned removing the caption and context of a photograph so that more observations are made to try to figure out what is going on. I think this article presents
          good strategies for our upcoming project.
        </p>

          I was able to apply these critical thinking, reading, and visual skills in a cool website I found on awaaards.com, which was an interactive site talking about Krzysztof Penderecki. The website, <a href="https://pendereckisgarden.pl/en/the-maestros-manor">Penderecki's Garden</a>
          uses useful images, videos, and music to tell the story of Penderecki, a great 20th century composer and gardener. The website is a virtual garden of the composer telling more of the composer's life story. Users can click around the site and explore different elements. The site is
          beautiful and is composed of millions of dots to create imagery. Once a user clicks on an element, an overlay presents the user with text information, a video or an image, and it feautres a bar at the bottom letting you know what percentage you have explored in the area you are in.
          There's a lot to explore on the Website and the movement within it makes it very interesting and visually-appealing.
          Not to mention the beautiful music that accompanies the searching! Please check it out, I barely touched based.

        <h2>Best Practices for Modals/Overlays </h2>
        <h3>April 22, 2021</h3>
        <p>  After reading <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</a> by Naema Baskanderi, I was able to understand the need
          to design functional and user-centered UX/UI design to make sure users are willing to engage with the application. </p>

            As a standard, certain things need to be considerd while designing these types of windows, such as an developing a way to escape, including a descriptive title,
            creating the container the right size for its main screen, and making sure to add focus to the new window by creating a lightbox effect.

        <h2>Best Coding and Design Practices</h2>
        <h3>April 17, 2021</h3>
        <p>A website that I feel uses good coding and design practices is the <a href="https://spotify.design/article/ask-spotify-design-03"> Spotify Design Website</a>. Despite using many divs in their code, it is used to keep the page nicely
          formatted and easily readible. </p>
        <p>
          For code, they have their banner at the top, with external links linked before their own styling pages, a body element which contains all the div classes used, a main element, and a footer. For design, they
          include a progress bar at the top which lets the reader know how much longer until the article is finished, have their paragraphs are condensed, include images, and use a nice color palette. I hope to use these designing practices when developing my own windows in future web designs.
