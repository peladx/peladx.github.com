        <h2>Best Practices for Modals/Overlays </h2>
        <h3>April 22nd, 2021</h3>
        <p>  After reading <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">est Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</a> by Naema Baskanderi, I was able to understand the need
          to design functional and user-centered UX/UI design to make sure users are willing to engage with the application. </p>
          <p>
            As a standard, certain things need to be considerd while designing these types of windows, such as an developing a way to escape, including a descriptive title,
            creating the container the right size for its main screen, and making sure to add focus to the new window by creating a lightbox effect.

        <h2>Best Coding and Design Practices</h2>
        <h3>April 17th, 2021</h3>
        <p>A website that I feel uses good coding and design practices is the <a href="https://spotify.design/article/ask-spotify-design-03"> Spotify Design Website</a>. Despite using many divs in their code, it is used to keep the page nicely
          formatted and easily readible. </p>
        <p>
          For code, they have their banner at the top, with external links linked before their own styling pages, a body element which contains all the div classes used, a main element, and a footer. For design, they
          include a progress bar at the top which lets the reader know how much longer until the article is finished, have their paragraphs are condensed, include images, and use a nice color palette. I hope to use these designing practices when developing my own windows in future web designs.
