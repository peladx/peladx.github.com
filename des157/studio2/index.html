              My siblings and I used to come to this park every single time we visited my grandparents. My other grandpa (pictured) lives in a town a couple minutes outside the city.
              He would come and meet us here and we would get ice cream. RIP.

              This cathedral is across the park and has been here since the 18th century. It's really beautiful on the inside, with the ceilings painted, stain glass windows, and more.
              My aunt got married here. Here is my mother, my sister, and my aunt at her wedding.

              The portales are behind the park and are filled with stores where one can shop or eat. The ceilings are also painted. My family and I get coffee here.
