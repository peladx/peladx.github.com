        <p> For the user testing, some of the feedback I received from my classmates included how the timeline would get cut off
          when they would scroll, there was an arrow at the bottom of the screen from the HTML, how the content did not fit on the screen well,
          how the titles would not match up, how I should consider changing the fonts used, and maybe incorporating more event listeners. I did receive
          positive feedback that included good color palette, good use of title size, nice vertical timeline, and overall nice theme. I plan to take this feedback
          and incorporate it into my final project.
