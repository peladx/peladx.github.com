        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p> For the final, I will be using what we learned for the Every Picture and creating a visual story of the timelime of covid-19  <thead>
          and the effect it had on the most vulnerable communities here in the United States.

        <p>I really like this portfolio page because it is very interactive. In the gallery tab, you can browse the pictures by clicking to the right for new pictures to appear.
          For a photography portfolio, it showcases the work well and is not boring to look at. It progresses through the photos in a horizontal manner instead of vertical, much like a photo album.
          I like not having to scroll. I also like how the column for different photoshoots
          is on the left so that the user can click on the title and be transported to the work. In terms of style, I really like the black and white look,
          as well as the unfilled letters. I think it can use more color though, especially on titles, or framing the pictures. I like the timeline feel though on the homepage.
          This is exactly how I want my timeline on my project to look like.

          <p>
            I like how this article using imagery to compliment the text. So when it is talking about a certain subject, such as the cost of individual items being more expensive than when sold
            through the prison food companies, the images of different packaged foods and their cost appears on the right. When speaking about limits, an infographic pops up. The scroll has different
            event listeners depending on the paragraph so that an image that compliments it turns up. I really like that idea as I want to speak about for example deaths from covid within a paragraph of my
            article and an infographic can turn up. I like the desgn better on this one, as I like the light background, bold title, header, column of the article, and use of color (tan, brown, black, and red).
            I plan on using some of these features on my own project (especially the styling).

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>
              My goal is to use the interaction elements we learned in our every picture project to create a visual story of the timeline of covid-19 and the impact it has had.
              I really like visual stories as you can sometimes see them in the LA times, Marshall Project, or other news sites. I think it makes the story more easy to comprehend
              and more exciting to read. I want my website users to have that same interactive experience and educate them as well, as well as document an important/scary historical moment.
            </p>
            <p>
              My project will differ from the comparison project because I am speaking on a certain subject, not making a portfolio (like the first project), and I am going to make it a timeline that is horizontal
              and be focused on user interaction/graphics and have less words
              (instead of the second project going vertical and being more of an article). I am going to use more colors as well.
              </p>

              <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
              <p>
                For design, I hope to include some Gestalt principles such as proximity, similarity, and connectedness. I liked the second project because of the spacing around the elements.
                As well as the first project the columns used and spacing. I want it to be visually clear, readable, and easy to interact. And I want the website to be colorful, but serious, as it
                is a serious subject, so maybe using color for the titles to make them stand out. The title will be bold, big and centered like the second project. And I want a modern look,
                so sans serif fonts and different/new photo editing techniques to my images.

              <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
                <p>
                  When the user clicks on the arrows from left or right on the timeline, the picture changes. It's a slideshow.
                  I might use some scroll interactivity as well to relate to the second project I explored.

                <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
              <p>
                I want the user to be able to visit the website and learn about the effects of the pandemic, presenting research and data in a way
                that is easily understandable, able to be visualized, and aesthetically pleasing. I plan to do this with my design and the Interaction
                elements.
